<h1>Industrial Safety Risk Management</h1>

<p>
Industrial accidents rarely occur due to a single mistake.
In most cases, accidents are the result of repeated structural weaknesses
within operational and safety management systems.
</p>

<h2>The Limitations of Conventional Safety Management</h2>
<p>
Traditional safety management focuses heavily on manuals, education, and inspections.
However, these approaches often fail to address the underlying structural causes of risk.
</p>

<h2>COREON’s Structural Approach</h2>
<p>
COREON approaches safety from a structural and operational perspective.
We design management frameworks that reduce safety risks
before incidents occur.
</p>

<h2>Application Scope</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Industrial facilities</li>
  <li>Construction sites</li>
  <li>Infrastructure projects</li>
</ul>
