<h1>Construction PM Risk Control</h1>

<p>
Many construction failures are not caused by poor execution,
but by inadequate project management structures.
</p>

<h2>Execution vs Management</h2>
<p>
COREON does not operate as a construction contractor.
We focus on designing and operating management structures
that control cost, schedule, and safety risks.
</p>

<h2>Why Structural PM Matters</h2>
<p>
Effective project management requires structural visibility,
clear authority flow, and risk-based decision frameworks.
</p>

<h2>COREON’s Role</h2>
<ul>
  <li>PM / CM structure design</li>
  <li>Risk-based project control</li>
  <li>Independent management framework</li>
</ul>
